<!-- **Abstract**. The field and community of Information Retrieval (IR) are changing and evolving in response to the latest developments and ad- vances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and research culture. As the field and community re-oriented and re-consider its positioning within com- puting and information sciences more generally – it is timely to gather and discuss more seriously our field’s vision for the future – the chal- lenges and threats that the community and field faces – along with the bold new research questions and problems that are arising and emerging as we re-imagine search. This workshop aims to provide a forum for the IR community to voice and discuss their concerns and pitch proposals for building and strengthening the field and community. -->

The field of Information Retrieval (IR) is undergoing a profound transformation, spurred by the continual evolution and breakthroughs in the realm of artificial intelligence and the broader changing research landscape. This reformation pe- riod finds our field and community in a state of introspection, as we contemplate and reevaluate our role and significance within the broader context of computing and information sciences. This juncture in our journey serves as an opportune moment to convene and engage in a deep and purposeful dialogue concerning the future trajectory of our field. We must collectively confront the myriad chal- lenges and potential threats that loom on the horizon, all while embracing the newfound opportunities and bold research inquiries that emerge as we embark on a re-imagined quest for the next generation “memex machine.

The purpose of this workshop is to serve as a dedicated platform for the IR community to candidly express and deliberate upon the issues that weigh on our collective conscience. It is a forum where we can voice our concerns and brainstorm and present innovative proposals aimed at fortifying and enriching our field and the community that sustains it.

As we stand at the intersection of technological innovation and scholarly in- trospection, we find ourselves confronted with a multitude of pertinent questions. How can we harness the power of AI to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval? What safeguards do we need to put in place to protect the integrity and privacy of the data we handle? How can we ensure that the fruits of our research are accessible and beneficial to all members of society? These are just a few examples of the pressing issues we face as we navigate this dynamic, new IR landscape.

In our pursuit of “search futures”, this workshop aims to provide the first

of several forums, for the community to discuss and contribute to our collective agenda for the research directions and field. We hope that together, we can chart

a course that not only safeguards IR’s continued relevance and vitality but also propels it into uncharted territories of discovery and exploration.

  - Can IR further optimize workplace productivity?
- IR ethics, trust and responsibility
  - What is the duty / responsible of an IR system?
  - If I want to see more, should the system give it to me?
  - How can we trust IR systems if they make up everything?
  - How environmentally responsible are the IR systems we are making?
- IR and people, users, consumers, creators,..
  - Are creators still needed in the age of generative AI?
  - Is IR helping overcome the digital divide?
  - Is IR addressing the disparity in information access, especially in marginal- ized communities?
  - Should IR systems curate information for users to avoid information overload?
  - What is the future of results presentation?

## 4  Organisers

<!-- To run the workshop, we have six organizers, five of whom can confirm that they will attend ECIR in person. Our organization team aims to bring together the IR Oldies with the up-and-coming stars in our field from industry, academia, and around the globe. -->
